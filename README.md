Movie Recommendation System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system developed using the 5000 TMDB movies dataset, accessed from Kaggle. It leverages various Python libraries to process and analyze data, ultimately recommending movies based on their content.

Key Technologies and Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Requests: To fetch necessary data from APIs.
NumPy: For efficient numerical operations.
Streamlit: To build an interactive web application for users.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
TensorFlow: For advanced model training and prediction.
The recommendation system suggests movies based on similarities in genres, descriptions, and other features, offering personalized recommendations to users.
